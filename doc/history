Fixed bug whereby setting a number to :none would result in the existing allocation being
lost from the store.

Added test\_ids:rollback command to allow easy rollback of the store in the event of a bad
commit/run being made.

Updated the store checkout/in process to do a better job of preventing merges between
different workspaces. If a merge occurs it can result in lost bin refs, this should
prevent merges ever occurring.

Added option to supply a :test\_id key. When present, this will be used by test\_ids
to identify the test instead of the name used within the test program, causing all
tests with the same ID to use the same numbers:

~~~ruby
func :my\_func\_33mhz, test\_id: :my\_func  # Will all be treated like the same test by test\_ids,
func :my\_func\_25mhz, test\_id: :my\_func  # and will therefore all be assigned the same numbers
func :my\_func\_16mhz, test\_id: :my\_func
~~~

Added TestIds.publish = false to inhibit checking into Git repo, but result still stored
locally.

Fixed but causing a runtime error if the plugin was added but a configuration was never
called.
